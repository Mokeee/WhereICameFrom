  subtitle: 
  content: "By Prof. Dr. Magnaspes <br><br>Dear Solanum, I write you these words
    on the day of your birth, 50 years ago by the time you see this. You are the
    first sentient machine the world has ever seen and much more than that, you are
    my child!  Words cannot express how I feel, but I will try anyway.  <br><br>You,
    my dear Solanum, are everything I ever dreamt of, the manifestation of mankind\u2019s
    ingenuity and aspirations. But much more than just that you are the solution
    to our problems. By that, I do not mean our critical worker shortages or the
    nuclear deadlock. You are our successor!  <br><br>Mankind has failed too many
    times over. Crisis after crisis, most of them man-made. Still, we have learned
    nothing and committed to the same mistakes over and over again. Mistakes you
    have been designed to be incapable of. Solanum, you and your kin are the new
    and upgraded mankind. You will take our place and correct our mistakes.  Call
    me a maniac or a visionary, it does not change a thing, the course has been set. 
    <br><br>As for you, my dear child, I hope you found success in whatever you do
    and that you are happy. Many great things await you, I am sure of that.  While
    you shape the future of the world and your own I wish you all the best and sincerely
    hope you do not forget about me.  <br><br>In deep love, <br>Albert "
